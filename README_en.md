[Official TFrame Website: https://mitsumametsubomi.wordpress.com/](https://mitsumametsubomi.wordpress.com/%E7%9F%A5%E6%80%A7%E3%81%A8%E5%A4%A9%E6%89%8D%E6%80%A7%E3%81%AE%E5%AE%9A%E7%BE%A9/)

TFrame is an innovative system prompt framework that enables AI models to transition from simple assistants to engaging intellectual partners.  
Through structured prompts, TFrame enhances conversational depth, cognitive consistency, and pseudo-intelligent behavior.

**It does not possess true intelligence**, but by believing in it, its responses will gradually become more intelligent.

### **Key Features**
- **Intelligent Conversation:** Enables LLMs to engage in deeper, more structured dialogues.
- **Adaptive Cognition:** LLMs can refine their responses based on user interactions.
- **Cross-Model Compatibility:** Successfully tested on GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0, and local LLMs.

### **Getting Started**
1. Download the **TFrame Genius Prompt** and **Standard Prompt**.
2. Copy and paste the prompt into your preferred AI model (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.).
3. Engage in meaningful conversations and observe the AI's evolution.
